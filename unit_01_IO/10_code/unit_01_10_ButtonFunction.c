  Objective:  Button Library - The Button Library provides routines for 
              detecting button presses and debouncing (eliminating the
              influence of contact flickering upon pressing a button).
              
       Note:  Unable Button on mikkoc Pro for PIC's Library Manager
             
  Prototype:  unsigned short Button(unsigned short *port, 
                                    unsigned short pin, 
                                    unsigned short time, 
                                    unsigned short active_state);

        PDL:  is a free-format English-like text that describes the flow of control and data in a
              program. PDL is not a programming language. It is a collection of some keywords that enable
              a programmer to describe the operation of a program in a stepwise and logical manner:

              BEGIN
                  Define TRUE as 1
                  Pre-compilation Directives (#ifdef -chip options- #else #endif)
                  Configure PORTB pin 0 as digital input
                  Configure PORTD pin 0 as digital output
                  DO FOREVER
                      IF button is pressed THEN
                      Toggle the LED
                      Wait .3s
                  ENDDO
              END
